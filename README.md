Repository housing codes for the implementation of the Markov chain model presented in "Exploiting evolutionary non-commutativity to prevent the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance" (doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493)
Additional codes provided for visualizing small combinatorially complete fitness lancapes
Finally, codes included for visualization small seascapes, or fitness landscapes with time-varying Genotype-Phenotype mapping.
Upon the latter, we have previously explored driving populations to evolutionary equilibria using a conceptual technique called counter-diabetic driving. Codes related to this project are found here:https://github.com/hincz-lab/Evolution-Counterdiabatic-Driving/pulse and have been published here: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/867143
